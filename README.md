Single Cell Downstream Analysis with Seurat in R


Results :

UMAP Visualization:



The UMAP plot  shows distinct clusters of cells on the bases of their gene expression . Every cluster have a identity number which representing the different cells within the pancreas tissue.  Clusters appear  separated and tightly grouped.  So the clusters which are separated  its indicating that  they have well defined subtypes.  And those which are spread shows that varying levels of similarity in gene expression .


Gene Expression Analysis with Scatter Plot:


The scatter plot comparing Gcg  and Rnf186 expression shows  that Gcg is highly expressed in specific clusters, labeled 8, 3, and 9. This high expression indicates these clusters may represent alpha cells or other hormone-producing cells
Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs):
The DEGs file highlighted key genes with significant expression differences across clusters. For example , Gcg showed high average log2 fold change in cluster 0, with nearly all cells in this cluster expressing it. This result aligns with the high presence of Gcg-positive cells in clusters observed in the scatter plot.

Other notable DEGs include Tmsb15b2, Irx2, and Ttr, each with high fold changes and significance in specific clusters. These genes serve as potential markers for distinguishing cell types within the pancreas, emphasizing their functional specificity.


Exciting Steps:
 I Visualize  the clusters with UMAP , as it allowed me to see the natural grouping of cells based on their expression profiles. Observing the separation by gender was also intriguing, as it suggests the potential for gender-specific gene expression patterns.
Finding differentially expressed genes and identifying markers for each cluster added an extra layer of understanding, showcasing the diversity and functional specialization within the tissue

Conclusions:


The distinct clustering of Gcg-expressing cells highlights the specificity of certain cell types, such as alpha cells, within the pancreas. This specificity, combined with Rnf186's broader expression, points to the pancreas's complexity, where each cell type plays a unique role in maintaining tissue function. Gender-based clustering hints at the possibility of sex-based biological variations at the cellular level, which could be significant in understanding disease susceptibility or therapeutic responses.

What I Gained from the biology after analysis :




Identifying cell subtypes by their unique gene expression patterns helps clarify each cell type's role. Understanding DEGs like Gcg, Tmsb15b2, and Ttr can shed light on the functional landscape within the pancreas and offers insights into potential targets for future research in endocrinology or regenerative medicine.
This analysis was valuable for understanding the complexity of the pancreas tissue and the unique contributions of each cell type. By learning how specific genes characterize different clusters, I gained insights into how gene expression patterns define cellular function and tissue structure.
